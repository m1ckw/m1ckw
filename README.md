Hi and welcome to my Github profile! 

In a nutshell: I'm passionate about Data, Data Analytics, Data Science, Coding and Software Development. <br>
Did I mention Data!? I like data.

Data in its own right isn't special, it's a collection of various signals, observations and measurements. It's often messy and uninteresting to look at. However, given the appropriate knowledge, technical skills, and enough creativity, you can discover unknown truths, find answers to complex questions, discover relationships, and create predictions. That's the beautiful thing about data, it's raw information just waiting to be interpreted. 
      
If you're here for something specific but don't see it in my public repositories please get in touch, It may just be private.
